Feeling imprisoned by his self- imposed exile, he is drawn out of hiding by a beautiful French tourist who reminds him of happier times in Paris. The Walter Wanger production was a remake of the successful 1937 French film\" P\u00e9p\u00e9 le Moko\", which derived its plot from the Henri La Barthe novel of the same name. \" Algiers\" was a sensation because it was the first Hollywood film starring Hedy Lamarr, whose beauty became the main attraction for film audiences. The film is notable as one of the sources of inspiration to the screenwriters of the 1942 Warner Bros. film\" Casablanca\", who wrote it with Hedy Lamarr in mind as the original female lead. Charles Boyer's depiction of the main character, Pepe Le Moko, inspired the Warner Bros. animated character, Pep\u00e9 Le Pew. In 1966, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication."

His family moved to Leningrad in 1930, where he learned to play the piano. He gave his first concert in 1935 with the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra. Schwartz's father was professor of archeology at the Leningrad State University: he was arrested in 1936 and executed two years later as part of the Great Purge. Schwartz's family was exiled to Kyrgyzstan in 1937, and Schwartz gave private music lessons in Frunze (now Bishkek) as well as occasionally accompanying the silent films at the cinema with live music. During the Second World War, Schwartz directed one of the sections of the Red Army Choir. During that time, he met Mariya Dmitriyevna, the sister of Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich, who introduced him to her brother. Shostakovich helped Schwartz gain entry to the Rimsky-Korsakov Conservatory in Leningrad, from whence he graduated with a diploma in composition in 1951. He joined the Union of Soviet Composers in 1955. Only years later did he discover that Shostakovich had paid for his education. When Shostakovich was dismissed from the Conservatory, Schwartz was asked to denounce Shostakovich, but he refused. Schwartz's first major commission was the music for the film \"Our Correspondent\" in 1959. He went on to compose the music for more than 100 Soviet films, including \"White Sun of the Desert\u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0446\u0435 \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044b\u043d\u0438\", 1969) and \"The Captivating Star of Happiness\u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044f\", 1975). Perhaps his best known work outside of the Soviet Union was for Akira Kurosawa's 1975 film \"Dersu Uzala\". He won the prestigious Nika Award of the Russian Academy of Cinema Arts and Sciences for 1992 for his music for the films \"White King, Red Queen\u0411\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c, \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\") and \"Luna Park\u041b\u0443\u043d\u0430-\u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a\"). Schwartz also composed music for ballets and theatrical performances and, to a lesser extent, for television. His one symphony, \"Gelbe Sterne \u2013 Purimspiel im Ghetto\", was first performed in Saint Petersburg in 2000: it was inspired by the story of the Kovno Ghetto in Lithuania. Schwartz died in Siversky, near Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation, on 27 December 2009, aged 86."

While not prosecuted for obscenity, the film was seized and confiscated in the UK under Section 3 of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 during the video nasty panic. The film has been noted by critics for its focusing on establishing characters as well as featuring an entirely arbitrary killer."

The film centers on a melodramatic love triangle between amiable banker Johnny( Wiseau), his deceptive fianc\u00e9e Lisa( Danielle) and his conflicted best friend Mark( Sestero). A significant portion of the film is dedicated to a series of unrelated subplots, most of which involve at least one supporting character and are left unresolved due to the film's inconsistent narrative structure. The work was reportedly intended to be semi-autobiographical in nature; according to Wiseau, the title alludes to the potential of a room to be the site of both good and bad events. The stage play from which the film is derived was so- called due to its events taking place in a single room. A number of publications have labeled\" The Room\" as one of the worst films ever made. An assistant professor of film studies was the first to describe\" The Room\" as\" the\" Citizen Kane\" of bad movies\". Originally shown only in a limited number of California theaters,\" The Room\" quickly became a cult film due to its bizarre and unconventional storytelling, technical and narrative flaws, and Wiseau's off- kilter performance. Although Wiseau has retrospectively described the film as a black comedy, audiences have generally viewed it as a poorly made drama, an opinion shared by some of the cast. \" The Disaster Artist\", Sestero's memoir of the making of\" The Room\", was co-written with Tom Bissell and published in 2013. A film of the same name based on the book, directed by and starring James Franco, was released on December 1, 2017; the book and film received widespread acclaim and numerous award nominations. \" The Room\" also inspired an unofficial video game adaptation,\" The Room Tribute\", released on Newgrounds in 2010."

Director K\u00e4utner was eventually able to convince officials that the propaganda sequence was in no way a reflection of his political ideology and was added at request of Nazi censors. The remainder of the film was fairly apolitical, and, as such, it was brought back in circulation a few years later; the propaganda end sequence is not seen on current prints of the film.

This version casts the famous Dickens characters as anthropomorphic animals; Ebenezer Scrooge and his relatives are skunks, Bob Cratchit and his family are rabbits, the ghost of Jacob Marley is a cricket, the Ghost of Christmas Past is a stork, the Ghost of Christmas Present is a kangaroo, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is a walrus. This version differs from the original novella in many ways; for example, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come actually speaks, while most other versions have him mute. Tiny Tim does n't die in the possible future revealed to Scrooge, but instead becomes as miserly as he is. And Jacob Marley is said to be dead two years, unlike the original in which he was dead for seven years. Scrooge's childhood home is also shown."

He was the son of Esm\u00e9 Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox, and his wife Katherine Clifton, 2nd Baroness Clifton, and the brother of James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond and 4th Duke of Lennox, and of the Royalist commander Lord Bernard Stewart. Stewart, his older brother Henry, and younger brother Ludovic were brought up at Aubigny in France as Roman Catholics under the charge of their paternal grandmother, the old Duchess-Dowager, Katherine de Balsac. Stewart's father, the Duke of Lennox, died in 1624, and Stewart became a ward of his cousin, King Charles I of England. He inherited the Lordship of Aubigny at the age of 14 on the death of his elder brother Henry in 1632. By 1633, he was a student at the Coll\u00e8ge de Navarre, part of the University of Paris, and he did homage to Louis XIII of France for the lordship of Aubigny on 5 August 1636, shortly after his eighteenth birthday. Later that year he moved to England. In 1638 he secretly married Katherine Howard, the daughter of Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk, and Elizabeth Home, without her father's consent, offending his guardian the king. The portrait of Stewart by Anthony van Dyck, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, may have been painted to mark his marriage; the Latin inscription can be translated \"Love is stronger than I am\" which may allude to his conflicting loyalties. His younger brothers Lords John and Bernard are shown in a still more famous double Van Dyck portrait in the National Gallery, London - the iconic image of Cavaliers. They were also both killed in the Civil War.\nGeorge Stewart and Katherine Howard had two children: He fought with the French against the Spanish in the Battle of Montju\u00efc (1641). As civil war loomed in England, Stewart joined the forces of King Charles at York where he was knighted on 18 April 1642 along with his brother Bernard. He was mortally wounded in the first pitched battle of the war at Edgehill on Sunday 23 October 1642, aged 24. He was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. The lordship of Aubigny passed to his next brother, Ludovic, on his death. His widow remarried James Levingston, 1st Earl of Newburgh and had one further child Elizabeth. They were suspected in 1648 of plotting to rescue Charles I and on the discovery of the supposed plot fled to the Netherlands where Katherine died in 1650."

He was the grandson of Esm\u00e9 Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox. On 10 December 1645 he was created Baron Stuart of Newbury, Berkshire, and Earl of Lichfield, titles conferred on him \"to perpetuate the titles which were intended to have been conferred on his uncle\" Lord Bernard Stewart, youngest son of the Duke of Lennox, who had been killed in the Battle of Rowton Heath in the English Civil War in September of that year. In January 1658, Charles Stewart went into exile in France, and took up his residence in the house of his uncle, Ludovic, seigneur d'Aubigny. In the following year he fell under the displeasure of The Protectorate's Council of State, and warrants were issued for seizing his person and goods. Charles Stewart married, firstly, Elizabeth Rogers, after June 1659. He married, secondly, Margaret Banaster (widow of William Lewis) on 31 March 1662. He married, thirdly, Frances Teresa Stewart, granddaughter of Walter Stewart, 1st Lord Blantyre, in March 1667. This last marriage was famous, as Frances Stewart, known at court as \"Le Belle Stuart\" had been desired by Richmond's cousin, King Charles II, as a mistress. Charles Stewart returned to England with Charles II in 1660, and sat in the Convention Parliament, showing great animosity towards the supporters of the Commonwealth. On the death of his 10-year-old cousin Esm\u00e9 Stewart on 10 August 1660, Charles Stewart succeeded as third Duke of Richmond and sixth Duke of Lennox. In that same year he was created Hereditary Great Chamberlain of Scotland, Hereditary Great Admiral of Scotland, and Lord-Lieutenant of Dorset. On 15 April 1661 he was invested with the Order of the Garter. On the death of his uncle, Ludovic Stuart, he succeeded him as 12th Seigneur D'Aubigny, for which title he did homage by proxy to Louis XIV of France on 11 May 1670. In July 1667, on the death of his cousin, Mary Butler, countess of Arran, he became Baron Clifton, and on 4 May 1668 he was made lord lieutenant and vice admiral of Kent jointly with the Earl of Winchilsea. In 1671 he was sent as ambassador to the Danish court to persuade Denmark to join England and France in a projected attack on the Dutch. While there he died (by drowning) in 1672, aged 33 at Elsinore, without issue, and his titles became extinct, with the exception of Baron Clifton, which passed with most of his property to his sister Katherine, Lady O'Brien. His wife, however, had had the Lennox estates granted to her for life. He was buried on 20 September 1673 at Westminster Abbey. The titles Duke of Richmond, Duke of Lennox and Earl of March, were resurrected for Charles II's illegitimate son by Louise de K\u00e9rouaille, Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond and Lennox, in 1675."

It is known for its crystal clear water and is surrounded by cottages on its shores. The blue waters of Blue Sea Lake, together with its dimensions and the absence of significant relief around, create the illusion of a sea. It feeds the Blue Sea River which empties into the Picanoc River, in turn a tributary of the Gatineau River. Its name first appeared on a map of Hull County in 1928. Just over to the west, in Cayamant, is another, somewhat smaller lake called\" Lac de la Mer Bleue\", which also means\" Blue Sea Lake\". To distinguish between these two lakes, the English name is used for the larger one, even in French."

Set in an isolated underwater facility, the film follows a team of scientists and their research on mako sharks to help fight Alzheimer's disease. The situation plunges into chaos when multiple genetically engineered sharks go on a rampage and flood the facility. \" Deep Blue Sea\" had a budget of$ 82 million and represented a test for Harlin, who had not made a commercially successful film since\" Cliffhanger\" in 1993. The film was primarily shot at Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where the production team constructed sets above the large water tanks that had been built for James Cameron's 1997 film\" Titanic\". Although\" Deep Blue Sea\" features some shots of real sharks, most of the sharks used in the film were either animatronic or computer generated. Trevor Rabin composed the film score; LL Cool J contributed two songs to the film:\" Deepest Bluest( Shark's Fin)\" and\" Say What\". Released in theaters during the film industry's summer season,\" Deep Blue Sea\" was a moderate commercial success, grossing more than$ 73 million in the United States and Canada, and$ 164 million worldwide. The film received generally mixed reviews from critics, who praised its suspense, pacing, and action sequences. Criticism was targeted at its unoriginality and B movie conventions. Retrospectively,\" Deep Blue Sea\" has been regarded as a successful shark film, especially within a limited genre that has been dominated by Steven Spielberg's 1975 thriller\" Jaws\". A direct- to- video sequel,\" Deep Blue Sea 2\", was released in 2018."

    "title": "Edward the Confessor",
    "text": "Edward the Confessor (1003 \u2013 5 January 1066), also known as Saint Edward the Confessor, was among the last Anglo-Saxon kings of England. Usually considered the last king of the House of Wessex, he ruled from 1042 to 1066. Edward was the son of \u00c6thelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy. He succeeded Cnut the Great's son \u2013 and his own half brother \u2013 Harthacnut. He restored the rule of the House of Wessex after the period of Danish rule since Cnut (better known as Canute) conquered England in 1016. When Edward died in 1066, he was succeeded by Harold Godwinson, who was defeated and killed in the same year by the Normans under William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings. Edgar the \u00c6theling, who was of the House of Wessex, was proclaimed king after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, but never ruled and was deposed after about eight weeks. Historians disagree about Edward's fairly long (24-year) reign. His nickname reflects the traditional image of him as unworldly and pious. Confessor reflects his reputation as a saint who did not suffer martyrdom, as opposed to King Edward the Martyr. Some portray Edward the Confessor's reign as leading to the disintegration of royal power in England and the advance in power of the House of Godwin, due to the infighting that began after his heirless death. Biographers Frank Barlow and Peter Rex, on the other hand, portray Edward as a successful king, one who was energetic, resourceful and sometimes ruthless; they argue that the Norman conquest shortly after his death tarnished his image. However, Richard Mortimer argues that the return of the Godwins from exile in 1052 \"meant the effective end of his exercise of power\", citing Edward's reduced activity as implying \"a withdrawal from affairs\". About a century later, in 1161, Pope Alexander III canonised the king. Saint Edward was one of England's national saints until King Edward III adopted Saint George as the national patron saint in about 1350. Saint Edward's feast day is 13 October, celebrated by both the Church of England and the Catholic Church in England and Wales."

His mother was a daughter of Fujiwara no Tokihira. His elder brother from the same mother Atsutoshi died before their father's death. In 977 he became Sadaijin, and when his cousin, the regent Fujiwara no Kanemichi was in a critical medical condition, he ceded the position of Kampaku (regent) to Yoritada, instead of his rival brother Kaneie. Although Yoritada's two daughters were consorts of Emperor En'y\u016b and Emperor Kazan, they did not have any sons. Yoritada thus had only a tenable blood relationship with the Emperors. His cousin Kaneie was the grandfather of Crown Prince Yasuhito (Emperor Ichij\u014d), and he encouraged Emperor Kazan to abdicate a throne. By the accession of Emperor Ichij\u014d, Yoritada retired from his post as Kampaku, and Kaneie became Sessho (regent) for his grandson Emperor Ichij\u014d. Yoritada was Daij\u014d Daijin from 978, and he is referred to as Rengi-k\u014d (\u5ec9\u7fa9\u516c) (posthumous name of Daij\u014d Daijin).

It's intended to be commonly recited by Virgin Islanders in unison at public events, especially in schools, and during public celebrations. The pledge was first publicly recited on 1 July 2016 at Territory Day celebrations by Premier Dr. D. Orlando Smith and members of the government. The pledge reads: Adoption of the pledge was a project of Myron Walwyn, the territory's Minister for Education and Culture. He explained that its adoption was part of the government's efforts\" to build a nation of citizens and residents that understand and have deep reverence for our heritage as Virgin Islanders\". In the same vein the government adopted a territorial song and an official territorial uniform. The government also erected flagpoles at each school and public schoolchildren now sing the territorial song as they raise the UK and VI flags each school day morning. The pledge has received a mixed reaction. Some questioned the need for a pledge at all. The reference to God in the pledge is a source of some element of controversy too. House of Assembly member, Alvera Maduro- Caines argued it was appropriate. She said she saw' nothing wrong with God being a part of the pledge as we are a Christian and God fearing society'. Others felt the overtly religious reference infringed their rights. The leader of the People \u2019s Empowerment Party, Natalio D. Wheatley, said there was a\" glaring problem\" with the pledge: that it is\" oxymoronic\" to refer to a territory as a country. The use of the capitalised term\" Territory\" suggests the word is part of the territory's name when it's not. Grammatically, the reference to\" these Virgin Islands\" rather than\" the Virgin Islands\" at the end of the pledge renders the pledge ungrammatical when recited outside the territory. There was little public engagement concerning the wording of the pledge before its adoption."

As was customary, the songs to be used in the broadcast were taped in advance as a back-up in case the live broadcast versions did not go well. The song was so well received that Decca Records decided to issue the pre-recording commercially and it charted briefly in June 1951 with a peak position of #19. Crosby used the song in his concert performances in 1976 singing it with comedian Ted Rogers. The duet with Louis Armstrong is still heard frequently on radio.

Starring Parker, Stone, Kristen Miller, Masasa Moyo, Daran Norris, Phil Hendrie, Maurice LaMarche, Chelsea Marguerite, Jeremy Shada and Fred Tatasciore , the film is a satire of big-budget action films and their associated clich\u00e9s and stereotypes, with particular humorous emphasis on the global implications of the politics of the United States. The title is derived from domestic and international political criticisms that the foreign policy of the United States frequently and unilaterally tries to \"police the worldTeam America\" follows the fictional titular paramilitary police force and their recruitment of a Broadway actor in an attempt to save the world from Kim Jong-il, who is leading a conspiracy of Islamic terrorists and liberal Hollywood actors in a bid for global destruction. Instead of live actors, the film uses a style of puppetry based on Supermarionation, known for its use in the British TV series \"Thunderbirds\", although Stone and Parker were not fans of that show. The duo worked on the script with former \"South Park\" writer Brady for nearly two years. The film had a troubled time in production, with various problems regarding the marionettes, as well as the scheduling extremes of having the film come out in time. In addition, the filmmakers fought with the Motion Picture Association of America, who returned the film over nine times with an NC-17 rating due to an explicit sex scene in the film. The film was cut by less than a minute and rated R for \"graphic crude and sexual humor, violent images and strong language \u2013 all involving puppets\". The film premiered at the Denver Film Festival on October 14, 2004, and was released theatrically in the United States the following day on October 15, 2004 by Paramount Pictures. It has received mostly positive reviews from critics and grossed over $51 million worldwide against its $32 million budget."

    "text": "Zhao Jiong (20 November 939 \u2013 8 May 997), known as Zhao Guangyi from 960 to 977 and Zhao Kuangyi before 960, also known by his temple name Taizong after his death, was the second emperor of the Song dynasty in China. He reigned from 976 to his death in 997. He was a younger brother of his predecessor Emperor Taizu, and the father of his successor Emperor Zhenzong. Why Emperor Taizong succeeded his brother rather than Emperor Taizu's grown sons (Zhao Dezhao and Zhao Defang, who both died in their twenties during his reign) is not entirely understood by later historians. According to official history, his succession was confirmed by Emperor Taizu on their mother Empress Dowager Du's deathbed as a result of her instruction. A popular story dating back from at least the 11th century suggests that Emperor Taizong murdered his brother in the dim candlelight when the sound of an axe was allegedly heard. Whatever the truth, Zhao Guangyi had been prefect of the Song capital Kaifeng since 961 where he gradually consolidated power. He was the only living prince during Emperor Taizu's reign (as Prince of Jin) and placed above all grand councilors in regular audiences. In the first three years of his reign, he intimidated the Qingyuan warlord Chen Hongjin and Wuyue king Qian Chu into submission and easily conquered Northern Han, thus reunifying China Proper for the first time in 72 years. However, subsequent irredentist wars to conquer former Tang dynasty territories from the Liao dynasty in the north and the Early L\u00ea dynasty in the southwest proved disastrous: after the failures in the Battle of Gaoliang River and the Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng, the Sixteen Prefectures and Northern Vietnam (at least in their entirety) would remain beyond Chinese control until the Ming dynasty in the 14th century. Emperor Taizong is remembered as a hardworking and diligent emperor. He paid great attention to the welfare of his people and made the Song Empire more prosperous. He adopted the centralization policies of the Later Zhou, which include increasing agricultural production, broadening the imperial examination system, compiling encyclopaedias, expanding the civil service and further limiting the power of \"jiedushis\". All subsequent emperors of the Northern Song were his descendants, as well as the first emperor of the Southern Song. However, from Emperor Xiaozong onwards, subsequent emperors were descendants of his brother, Emperor Taizu. This largely stemmed from the Jingkang Incident, whereby most of Emperor Taizong's descendants were abducted by the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty, forcing Emperor Gaozong to seek a successor among Taizu's descendants, as Gaozong's only son had died young."

He took his mother's maiden name, Inman, in part because his name became\" Will In Man\". He worked in a shipyard during World War II, and became an activist in 1947 after summers of work in the Blue Ridge mountains. He attempted, unsuccessfully, to organize tobacco industry workers. Like many in the American left, he joined the Communist party but became disillusioned with its lack of humanity and left the organization. He was called before the Un- American Activities Committee in 1956 where he was accused of being the head of the Communist Party in North Carolina. Inman took the fifth in response to all questions. Attempting a new start, he moved to New York City to begin life anew, working in libraries while focusing on writing in his free time. From 1964 to 1977 he edited and published the seminal poetry newsletter\" Kauri\", part of the Mimeo Revolution of the Sixties, where he published the work of Charles Bukowski, Clarence Major, Walter Lowenfels, William Packard, Ron Silliman, John Sinclair. The title, Kauri, is the Hindi word for the seashell known to English speaking peoples as a cowrie shell. In 1967 he was appointed Poet- in- Residence at American University, teaching there and at Montgomery College in Rockville, Maryland. He has also been an activist for many humanist causes including anti-war and gay rights efforts. He moved to Tucson, Arizona in 1973. [ 1] His anthology Fired Up with You: Poems of a Niagara Vision was one of the earliest anthologies to include the poetry of Jimmy Santiago Baca as well as the pioneering feminist writer Barbara Mor. He completed a memoir in 1998 but Red Crane Books decided not to publish it. A copy of his memoir has been donated to the Rubenstein Rare Book Library at Duke University. He died in 2009 after having Parkinson's disease. His letters, manuscripts, and publications are collected at Duke University and at the University of North Carolina Wilmington."

The song was featured in Laurel and Hardy's 1937 film \"Way Out West\".

Patterson, son of Wimbledon champion Gerald Patterson, attended his father's school, Scotch College, Melbourne, from 1931 to 1934, and Geelong Grammar School from 1935 to 1941. He was one of a brace of new drivers that emerged after World War II, first appearing in the Australian Grand Prix in 1948 driving a stripped down MG TC. After improving the MG as far as he was able, he moved to a JAP powered Cooper Mk. V in 1953. Patterson used this to win his first national title, the 1954 Australian Hillclimb Championship. In the scorching heat of a Western Australian summer in 1957, Patterson stepped into Lex Davison's Ferrari 625 F1 as a relief driver, working together to defeat Stan Jones to win the 1957 Australian Grand Prix. A succession of grand prix Coopers followed. The biggest year of Patterson's career was 1961. Victories at Mount Panorama, Lowood, Caversham and a second at Longford saw Patterson dominate the 1961 Australian Drivers' Championship, scoring 51 points to Lex Davison's 15 to win the Gold Star. Patterson raced on for a few more years and took part in the inaugural Tasman Series in 1964, but after that Patterson stepped away from the sport as a driver, but stayed as an entrant, sponsor and team boss. Patterson Holden dealership Bill Patterson Motors supported several drivers over the following decades, open wheelers for the rest of the 1960s and on into the 1970s. In 1977 Patterson purchased touring car racing team, Team Brock which he ran for a year. Patterson's name continued to be seen in the sport into the 2000s in Speedway racing.
